# We will get more in-depth about jq functions in a later lesson.
# A function begins with "def", ends with ";", and consists of a 
# single pipeline just like a "main" jq program.
#
# For now, your job is to implement the logic of the tasks in the function
# bodies, so that they output the correct values.
